# MaritimeFlow

## Project Overview

**MaritimeFlow** is an advanced Python-based real-time simulation and analytics platform that integrates multiple free AIS (Automatic Identification System) APIs to provide comprehensive maritime tracking and supply chain disruption analysis. This platform combines live vessel data with sophisticated machine learning models to predict port congestion, optimize shipping routes, and provide actionable insights into global supply chain vulnerabilities during an era of unprecedented maritime challenges.

## Current Maritime Context and Motivation

The global shipping industry faces extraordinary challenges in 2025, with port congestion reaching critical levels and supply chain disruptions becoming the new normal. Recent data reveals that 76% of European shippers experienced supply chain disruptions throughout 2024, with average delays increasing to 84 days for Europe-to-Asia shipments. The Red Sea crisis alone disrupted $6 billion in weekly trade flows, while the Panama Canal drought reduced transit capacity by 32%. MaritimeFlow addresses these critical challenges by providing real-time visibility and predictive analytics to help businesses navigate the increasingly complex maritime landscape.

The shipping industry, responsible for 90% of global trade and handling 250 million TEUs annually, has seen dramatic increases in freight rates, with Asia-Europe routes experiencing 243% cost increases between December 2023 and January 2024. Major ports including Shanghai, Ningbo, Singapore, and Los Angeles are experiencing delays of 14-21 days, creating cascading effects throughout global supply chains. The maritime AI market, valued at $4.3 billion in 2024 and projected to grow at 40.6% CAGR through 2030, represents the technological frontier for addressing these challenges.
